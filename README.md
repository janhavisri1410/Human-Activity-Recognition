Human Activity Recognition is one of the active research areas in computer vision for various contexts like security surveillance, healthcare and human computer interaction. In this paper, a total of thirty-two recent research papers on sensing technologies used in HAR are reviewed. The review covers three area of sensing technologies namely RGB cameras, depth sensors and wearable devices. It also discusses on the pros and cons of the mentioned sensing technologies. The findings showed that RGB cameras have lower popularity when compared to depth sensors and wearable devices in HAR research
